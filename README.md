# Advances-in-Financial-Machine-Learning

Experimental answers to exercises from the book "Advances in Financial Machine Learning" by Marcos López de Prado (https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Advances+in+Financial+Machine+Learning-p-9781119482086)


The contents of the notebooks provided in this repository are intended as a guideline for the students/researchers who are interested in rationally apply machine learning concepts to the field of quantitative finance based directly on the contents from the book (which include not only original contents written by Professor Marcos López de Prado, but also serveral reseach papers, studies, and many references in related fields).


**Disclaimer**

All the original codes and snippets in the book had been implemented using Python 2.7 which may not work for the current Python version (Python 3.11). Many of the snippets may need to be updated due to serveral deprecatied functions/attributes/methods used in the book. 

Almost all of the functions/classes in these notebooks (apart from the code snippets excerpted from the book) were written from scratch and will be used as a private repository.
